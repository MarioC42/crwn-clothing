# This Project, is one from [complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/30962166?start=150#overview)

##### I am using it to get a better understanding of how ReactJS works, and learn some good practices. My plan is to code daily, and push daily to git.

## If you want to try this app for yourself, make sure to git clone this repository, and install the node modules. (React, react-router, firebase, (...MoreWillCome))
